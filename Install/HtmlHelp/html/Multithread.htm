<P>The Firebird ODBC driver provides two levels of thread protection.
Via the sharing of either environment or connection handles.</P>

<P>If the driver is built using the following define:

	<ul><B>#define DRIVER_LOCKED_LEVEL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DRIVER_LOCKED_LEVEL_NONE</B></ul>

then the driver is built without multi-threading support. This provides for fastest
performance, however responsibility for threading control is transferred to the Firebird
client library.</P>

<P><B>Default</B>: The driver is built using the following define:

	<ul><B>#define DRIVER_LOCKED_LEVEL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DRIVER_LOCKED_LEVEL_CONNECT</B></ul>

then a single connection can share multiple local threads.</P>

<P>If the driver is built using the following define: </P>

	<ul><B>#define DRIVER_LOCKED_LEVEL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DRIVER_LOCKED_LEVEL_ENV</B></ul>

then a single environment handle can be shared by multiple local threads.</P>
