<P><A NAME="hid_data_type_array"></A><h1>Data type Array</h1></P>

<P>To modify single dimension array data type fields, you need to conform to the following rules:</P>

<P>- Simple types (integer etc) specify as {1, 2, 3}<BR>
- String types (char etc) specify as {'1’, ‘2’, ‘3’}</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you edit an element of the array e.g. element 1, 2 and 5 and do not specify the other elements of the array,
e.g. 3 and 4 then the other elements of the array will be zeroed (integer), or blank (string).
With some programs where columns are dependent on array data,
It is possible, if the array column is null to enter the column data without a check being made
on the various array elements for the validity of that column data. In such circumstances it
is necessary to enter the array elements before entering the column data.</P>
