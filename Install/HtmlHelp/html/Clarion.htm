<h2>Using the Firebird ODBC driver with Clarion</h2>

Clarion users can work with mixed case object names in Firebird.<p>
<ol>
<li>Create your database in Firebird. You can use table names like
"Pending_Invoices" and fields like "Order_Number".</li>
<li>Create the DSN for the Database, making sure to check all options in
"Extended Identifier Properties"</li>
<li>Open your dictionary, and import multiple tables as normal from the
odbc source. It will work, but do not try to browse or use the files in
an application yet.</li>
<li>For every field, type in the 'External Name' the name of the field
surrounded by quotes (for example, type "Order_Number" in the external
name).</li>
<li>That's it! Now use your dictionary with Mixed_Case_Identificators
without problems. But remember - you must use double quotes around object names
in all sql statements from inside Clarion.</li>
</ol>
