 *	2003-03-24	Value.cpp
 *				Contributed by Norbert Meyer
 *				Improve memory cleanup Value::getString()
 
 *	2003-03-24	IscColumnsResultSet.cpp
 *				Contributed by Norbert Meyer
 *				o Add some breaks to case statements in adjustResults()
 *				o In IscColumnsResultSet::getBLRLiteral use delete[] s
 *				  instead of delete.s
 
 *	2003-03-24	IscResultSet.cpp
 *				Contributed by Andrew Gough
 *				In IscResultSet::reset() delete the 'conversions' 
 *				array itself as well as the array elements.

 *	2003-03-24	IscConnection.cpp
 *				Contributed by Norbert Meyer
 *				If ++attachment means attachment->addRef() then
 *				let's say so.

 *	2003-03-24	IscStatement.cpp
 *				Contributed by Norbert Meyer
 *				use value->setString (length, data, true); if not, 
 *				the String is not nullterminated, but used as
 *				nullterminated String in ODBCStatement::setValue()
 *				(case SQL_C_CHAR: ...). You can also check the 
 *				length in ODBCStatement::setValue, but there is no
 *				function getStringLength...

 *	2003-03-24	OdbcConnection.cpp
 *				Contributed by Norbert Meyer (NOMEY)
 *				delete Statements before close connection 
 *				(statement-destructor needs connection-pointer 
 *				for call connection->deleteStatement.  
 *				If connection->deleteStatement not called, 
 *				you get an AV if you use Statements and call 
 *				  SQLDisconnect(...); 
 *				  SQLFreeHandle(..., connection);

 *	2003-03-24	OdbcStatement.cpp
 *				Contributed by Norbert Meyer (NOMEY)
 *				o In sqlExtendedFetch() add support for
 *				  applications which only check rowCountPointer
 *				o In setValue()
 *				  Empty strings have len = 0, so test for that
 *				o In setParameter() and executeStatement()
 *				  test for binding->indicatorPointer

 *	2003-03-24	OdbcStatement.cpp
 *				IscStatement.cpp
 *				Contributed by Carlos Guzman Alvarez
 *				Remove updatePreparedResultSet from OdbStatement 
 *				and achieve the same goal in another way.

 *				Fix a segv in SQLBindCol()

 *	2003-03-24	main.cpp

 *				entry point. A C function entry is used 
 *				allowing correct binding to the driver manager.
