ok, in case you don't have the wonderful ODBCConfig, here is what it 
takes to set it up manually (thanks to Vladimir Tsvigun):
(On debian unstable, using the FB1.02 deb)

first, untar the OdbcJdbc_Snapshot.tar.gz into /usr/lib

Then you should have this in /usr/lib:
libOdbcFb.so*


The odbc-config-files in /etc shoud look like this:

odbcinst.ini:
--------------------
[Firebird]
Description     = InterBase/Firebird ODBC Driver
Driver          = /usr/lib/libOdbcFb.so
Setup           = /usr/lib/libOdbcFb.so
Threading 	= 1
FileUsage       = 1
CPTimeout       =
CPReuse         =

odbc.ini:
-----------------
[your_datasource_name]
Description     = Firebird
Driver          = Firebird
Dbname          = localhost:/var/lib/firebird/data/bla.gdb
User            =
Password        =
Role            =
CharacterSet    =
ReadOnly        = No
NoWait          = No
