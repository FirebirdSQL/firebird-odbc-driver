   How to compile guide with free Borland C++ Command Line 
                     Tool version 5.5.1

   In order to compile OdbcJdbc Firebird driver with free Borland C++ 
Command Line Tool version 5.5.1, few steps are necessary to be followed. 
This is complete guide, from compiler download, compiler installation, 
few preparation to compile and compiling driver itself. Complete process 
is organized in few sections.

I hope this little guide will be useful.

Installing Borland C++ free Commandline tool v 5.5.1 

1. Download Borland C++ free Commandline tool v 5.5.1 from Borland's 
   official site at www.borland.com. File is named as 
   freecommandLinetools.exe

2. Execute freecommandLinetools.exe and follow instructions. 
   Assuming chosen folder is:

	 c:\Borland\BCC55


   Creating needed odbccp32.lib file. File odbccp32.lib need 
to be created in order to compile driver

1. Find odbccp32.dll library in Windows system folder (in W2000, 
   it is usually in c:\winnt\system32) and copy it into temp folder.

2. Create odbccp32.lib file from odbccp32.dll with following command:

	c:\Borland\Bcc55\Bin\implib -c odbccp32.lib odbccp32.dll

3. Copy created file odbccp32.lib to following folder:

	c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib\PSDK 


Compiling OdbcJdbc driver itself


1. Create temp folder, for example:

	md C:\FBODBC

2. Create following sub folders:

	md C:\FBODBC\Firebird
        md C:\FBODBC\Firebird\Include
	md C:\FBODBC\OdbcJdbc

3. Extract OdbcJdbc sources to C:\FBODBC\OdbcJdbc

4. Download Firebird sources from official site www.firebird.org.

5. Extract Firebird sources to some other temp folder and copy to

	C:\FBODBC\Firebird\Include only following files:

	blr.h
	fb_types.h
	ibase.h
	iberror.h

6. Check and change paths to your correspondent paths from file:

	c:\FBODBC\OdbcJdbc\Builds\makefile.environ

	In this case, paths are follows: 

	FBINCDIR	= c:\FBODBC\Firebird\include
	FBLIBDIR	= c:\FBODBC\Firebird\lib


7. Depending on chosen environment, execute one of the following 
   batches in order to create OdbcJdbc DLLs:

	From folder c:\FBODBC\OdbcJdbc\Builds\Bcc55.win

	For NT (W2000/XP/w2003) - BuildNT.bat
	For W98/Me              - Build98.bat


	Resulting DLLs are in folder:

	c:\FBODBC\OdbcJdbc\Builds\Bcc55.win\Release

8. Install driver with following command (not recommended):

	From folder c:\FBODBC\OdbcJdbc\Builds\Bcc55.win

	RegSvr32 .\OdbcJdbcSetup.dll

9. If last command fails, using full paths to regsvr32 and 
   OdbcJdbcSetup.dll may be of help. For W2000, that is following 
   command (recommended):

	c:\winnt\system32\RegSvr32 /i c:\FBODBC\OdbcJdbc\Builds\Bcc55.win\Release\OdbcJdbcSetup.dll

10. Enjoy using Firebird through ODBC!



    Special thanks to Vladimir Tsvigun for wonderful job maintaining 
and improving this driver, for all his help and support.
